# Module 1: Cloud and AWS Basics

---

## Why cloud?

Yell out loud the benefits! üîä

---

# Overview of cloud computing

* IaaS
* PaaS
* FaaS
* SaaS

---

# Main concepts: Regions and AZs

---

# Main AWS Services

* EC2
* S3
* Glacier
* EBS
* VPC
* CloudWatch
* Alerts
* RDS

---

# Billing and calculator

---

# What you need or lab 0

---

## Slides&code

Repo: <https://github.com/azat-co/aws-intro>

Git clone (you can fork first too):

```
git clone https://github.com/azat-co/aws-intro.git
```

Download with CURL and unzip (create a new folder):

```
curl  https://codeload.github.com/azat-co/aws-intro/zip/master | tar -xv
```

---

## AWS account: Free tier

* Sign up for free tier with an email you have access to
* Random verification (phone call or wait - ask me for access to my account)
* Debit/credit Card for verification and paid services



---

## AWS account: Free tier (cont)

Free tier: <https://aws.amazon.com/free>, examples:

* EC2: 750 hours of t2.micro (~1 month of 1 EC2) - more than enough for this class and then some more
* S3: 5Gb
* RDS: 750 hours
* Lambda: 1,000,000 requests/mo
* More products!

---

## Node and npm

```
node --version
npm --version
```

I develop natively on my dev machine, but you can use another EC2 instance

## Checklist

# Module 2: Main EC2 Concepts

---

# EC2 Lifecycle

![inline](images/instance_lifecycle.png)


---

# "Stopped" to "running"

* Rounded to an hour for billing (no charges for "stopped")
* A new private IPv4 address unless in VPC or IPv6
* A new public IPv4
* Only EBS instances (more on storage later)
* More [*Differences Between Reboot, Stop, and Terminate*](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html)

---

# Images

![inline](images/architecture_ami_instance.png)

---

# Images

* AMI can convert to/from other image types
* Marketplace
* Can create your own images
* images IDs for the same OS differ from region to region
* AMIs can be backed by EBS or instance store

---

# Images (cont)

* OS, e.g., Amazon Linux
* HVM
* bit, e.g., 64 bit
* Any software?

---

# Root Device: EBS vs. Instance store

* EBS is faster to boot
* More EBS can be added later
* EBS allows to stop and restart
* Persistent ‚ÄîEBS data is saved
* Comparison [Storage for the Root Device](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ComponentsAMIs.html#storage-for-the-root-device)


---

# Types

* Category (t)
* Generation (2)
* Size (micro)

t2.micro

All types: <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types>

---

# IAM

---

# User Data

---

# Storage

* SSD
* Provisioned
* Magnetic

---

# Tags

---

# Spot vs. Reserved

---

# Key pairs

---

# Security groups

---

# ELB

# Elastic IP

---

# VPC, subnets and AZs

^We will talk more about VPC and subnets in the next modules

# ‚ùì Questions? ‚ùì

# Demo Time üíª

* Demo: Launching EC2
  * Launching EC2: images (Amazon Linux), types (t2.micro), storage (8Gb), tags (role=aws-course)
  * Creating security groups (ICMP for ping, SSH and HTTP are open)
  * Working with SSH key pairs
  * Connecting to EC2 via SSH

# Lab 1: WP is King

Task: Create an instance with WordPress, make the website visible in the browser *publicly*

# Module 3: Environment and App Deploy Automation

---

## SSH-ing into each new machine manually is not optimal... what to do?

---

## User Data

2nd step, advanced settings

---

![fit](images/user-data-ec2-config.png)

---

When you specify user data, note the following:

* User data is treated as opaque data (AWS won't check it, it's up to instance to interpret and execute)
* Executed only at launch
* Limited to 16 KB. (raw data, not base64-encoded)
* User data must be base64-encoded before being submitted to the API. The AWS CLI and the Amazon EC2 web console do encoding for you.  For more information about base64 encoding, see <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648>.
* Must start with `#!/bin/bash` or similar for shell

---

Note: There are many other solutions for environment and app built, test and deploy automation. We will cover some of them in *AWS Intermediate*.

---

## Demo: User Data for Apache httpd and HTML page

```

```

---

## Demo: User Data for a Node app with pm2 (restart on reboot)

hello-world-server.js:

```js
const port = 3000
require('http')
  .createServer((req, res) => {
    console.log('url:', req.url)
    res.end('hello world')
  })
  .listen(port, (error)=>{
    console.log(`server is running on ${port}`)
  })
```


---


```
#!/bin/bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.1/install.sh | bash
. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
nvm install 6.7
echo "const port = 3000
require('http')
  .createServer((req, res) => {
    console.log('url:', req.url)
    res.end('hello world')
  })
  .listen(port, (error)=>{
    console.log(`server is running on ${port}`)
  })
" >> hello-world-server.js
npm i -g pm2@2.4.3
pm2 start ./hello-world-server.js -i 0 --name "node-app"
sudo pm2 startup
sudo pm2 save
```

## Lab 2: Hello world Baby

Task: Launch an instance with "Hello World" HTTP server (Node.js), make the website visible in the browser *publicly*. Do not SSH!

Detailed instructions in labs/lab-02.md, Node server code is in code/index.js

Time:20 min

## Module 4: Auto Scaling

* Alerts and CloudWatch
* Demo: Create a launch config, auto scaling group and policy to increase instances
* Demo: Create a launch configuration, autoscaling group and see if it works
* Lab 3: Deploy 2 Node apps under ELB, load test it to see if autoscaling works
